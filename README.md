# Minecraft-RemoteLAN
Multicast proxy to help playing LAN worlds remotely.

Run Minecraft-RemoteLAN on any Linux machine on your network, and have your friend do the same.  Add their IP address to /etc/mc-remotelan/peers.list, and have them do the same with your's.  Open a Minecraft world to the LAN and it will be available on the other side.

This works best if there is already a VPN tunnel between the locations.
